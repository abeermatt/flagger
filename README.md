# Flagger

This project aims to be a tool that provides a simple, configurable Flag (enabled / disabled) system. 

This has many uses. i.e. enabling specific features, A/B testing.

### iOS

This iOS folder has a simple framework for accessing Flags. It is protocol based meaning you can provide your own implementations. There are some very simple implementations of most of the protocols.

### Elixir

This does not exist yet! However it will be a Phoenix based application providing a very simple Flag store.
